/// This structure is coded to achieve event-subsetting. Receivers in Rust are blocking. One cannot
/// listen to multiple receivers at the same time except by using `try_recv` which again is bad for
/// the same reasons spin-lock based on some sleep is bad (wasting cycles, 50% efficienct on an
/// average etc.). Consider a module that listens to signals from various other modules. Different
/// modules want to talk to this one. So one solution is make a common event set and all senders
/// (registered in all the interested modules) send events from the same set. This is bad for
/// maintenance. Wrong modules might use events not expected to originate from them since it is just
/// one huge event-set. Thus there is a need of event-subsetting and distribute this module-wise so
/// we prevent modules from using wrong events, completely by design and code-mechanics. Also we
/// don't want to spawn threads listening to different receivers (which could force to share
/// ownership and is anyway silly otherwise too). This is what `EventSender` helps to salvage. A
/// simple mechanism that does what a `skip-list` in linked list does. It brings forth a concept of
/// an Umbrella event-category and an event subset. The creator of `EventSender` hard-codes the
/// category for different observers. Each category only links to a particular event-subset and
/// type information of this is put into `EventSender` to during it's construction. Thus when
/// distributed, the modules cannot cheat (do the wrong thing) by trying to fire an event they are
/// not permitted to. Also a single thread listens to many receivers. All problems solved.
